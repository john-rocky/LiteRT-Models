// A tool with the real schema and no body.
//
// The benchmark has to show the model exactly what the app shows it — same
// name, same description, same argument schema, so routing and guided decoding
// are exercised unchanged — while calling it must move nothing in the world:
// no location prompt, no speech, no app switch to Maps mid-run. `call` returns
// a canned result and that is all. What the model actually called is read back
// from the session transcript afterwards, the same way the stage replay does.
